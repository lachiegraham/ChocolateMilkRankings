            <h3>June 2025. A chocolate milk tour of Europe</h3>
            <p>My older brother has recently been on a holiday of Europe. He texted me regular updates on the chocolate milk situation throughout his travels. Europe seems to have a good selection of chocolate milks. Expand this post to see what kinds of texts I got.</p>

                    <h4>June 4 2025. Day one</h4>
                    <p>Just 3 hours after touching down in London I recieved my first update. It's almost as if the first thing he did in this new country was to locate a chocolate milk.</p>
                    <div class="centeralign">
                        <img src="europe-1.JPG" alt="Cacaolat Cocoa Milk">
                        <p>Cacaolat 'Cocoa Milk'</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>With this came a little description: "Cocoa milk is correct, very cocoa flavour. More cocoa milk than chocolate milk"</p>
                    <p>I think it looks good.</p>

                    <p>It's a new day in London, and there's a new text message in my notifications.</p>

                    <p>"You would like this one. Basically melted Cadbury in a thick shake"</p>
                    <p>Bought as part of a $8 Tesco meal deal (or £8 I guess technically) that came with a sandwich and a packet of chips. Shoutout Tesco that's pretty sick.</p>
                    <p>And yeah, why can't I buy this in Australia. Why hasn't Cadbury Australia figured out the joys of liquid chocolate. Why must I go without this. Why.</p>

                    <p>So I sent the chocolate coconut water to my brother, and a few hours later he sent me back this:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Okay so müller was originally a German brand but they have a UK division that sells different stuff to the German one. For example, flavoured milks.</p>
                    <p>This particular flavour, fudge brownie, sounds pretty interesting to me. "Tastes exactly like advertised" says the brother.</p>
                    <p>müller apparently does limited edition flavours such as raspberry doughnut and Jaffa cake, although this flavour is one of their permanent ones.
                         I wonder if someone in the UK has reviews of all the historical limited editions. That'd be cool.</p>

            <p>Hi. I've been working on getting live price data from the big 2 supermarkets, and as of now I've got Woolworths working.</p>
            <p>The goal is basically to give myself an easy way to check which supermarket I should go to for my "essentials".</p>

            <h3>June 8 2025. Chocolate flavoured... coconut water?</h3>
            <img src="cocobella_chocolate_coconut.jpg">
            <p>I'm not really sure if this can be considered a chocolate milk, since, well, it's not milk.</p>
            <p>I bought it anyway.</p>
            <p>Did I like it? Not particularly. I don't like coconut water when it's coconut water flavoured, and in my opinion the
                 words "chocolate" and "water" should never be put in the same sentence under any circumstances. It was, however, better than expected.</p>
            <p>I would still probably put it as a mid tier entry, but who knows - maybe someone that likes coconut water
                will think this is amazing. This is not really my area of expertise.</p>
            <p>So with that being said, you will not be finding chocolate coconut water in the ranking website. 
                And you will not be finding this stuff in my fridge. I will be sticking to drinks made with milk.
