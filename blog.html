            <h3>June 10 2025. Chocolate flavoured... coconut water?</h3>
            <img src="cocobella_chocolate_coconut.jpg">
            <p>I'm not really sure if this can be considered a chocolate milk, since, well, it's not milk.</p>
            <p>I bought it anyway.</p>
            <p>Did I like it? Not particularly. I don't like coconut water when it's coconut water flavoured, and in my opinion the
                 words "chocolate" and "water" should never be put in the same sentence under any circumstances. It was, however, better than expected.</p>
            <p>I would still probably put it as a mid tier entry, but who knows - maybe someone that likes coconut water
                will think this is amazing. This is not really my area of expertise.</p>
            <p>So with that being said, you will not be finding chocolate coconut water in the ranking website. 
                And you will not be finding this stuff in my fridge. I will be sticking to drinks made with milk.
