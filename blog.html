            <h3>September 2025. Essay - Chocolate milk as a sports drink</h3>
            <p>Here's an informal little write-up of anything related to "benefits" of chocolate milk.</p>
            <p>Let's be real for a second, chocolate milk is not good for you. Doesn't matter how much protein they
                shove into it, it doesn't matter how sugar-free it claims to be, it's still worse for you than plain milk. We know this. This is obvious. This is not what I'm here to argue.

            <div id="collapsible2" style="display: none;">
                <p>In high school, year 9 I believe, my PE teacher made the claim that chocolate milk was the best pre-sport drink. Better than gatorade, better than water, better than a banana smoothie.</p>
                <p>whoever that olympic swimmer was, a little bit of theory for why, then we've just got science numbers ig.</p>

            <h3>June 2025. A chocolate milk tour of Europe</h3>
            <p>My older brother has recently been on a holiday of Europe. He texted me regular updates on the chocolate milk situation throughout his travels. Europe seems to have a good selection of chocolate milks. Expand this post to see what kinds of texts I got.</p>
            <div id="collapsible1" style="display: none;">
                <div class="innerBox">
                    <h4>June 4 2025. Day one</h4>
                    <p>Just 3 hours after touching down in London I received my first update. It's almost as if the first thing he did in this new country was to locate a chocolate milk.</p>
                    <div class="centeralign">
                        <img src="europe-1.JPG" alt="Cacaolat Cocoa Milk">
                        <p>Cacaolat 'Cocoa Milk'</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>With this came a little description: "Cocoa milk is correct, very cocoa flavour. More cocoa milk than chocolate milk"</p>
                    <p>I think it looks good.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="innerBox">
                    <h4>June 5 2025. Day two</h4>
                    <p>It's a new day in London, and there's a new text message in my notifications.</p>
                    <div class="centeralign">
                        <img src="europe-2.JPG" alt="Cadbury Creamy Chocolate Milkshake">
                        <p>Cadbury 'Creamy Chocolate Milkshake'</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>"You would like this one. Basically melted Cadbury in a thick shake"</p>
                    <p>Bought as part of a $8 Tesco meal deal (or £8 I guess technically) that came with a sandwich and a packet of chips. Shoutout Tesco that's pretty sick.</p>
                    <p>And yeah, why can't I buy this in Australia. Why hasn't Cadbury Australia figured out the joys of liquid chocolate. Why must I go without this. Why.</p>

                    <h4>June 8 2025. Another one</h4>
                    <p>So I sent the chocolate coconut water to my brother, and a few hours later he sent me back this:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Okay so müller was originally a German brand but they have a UK division that sells different stuff to the German one. For example, flavoured milks.</p>
                    <p>This particular flavour, fudge brownie, sounds pretty interesting to me. "Tastes exactly like advertised" says the brother.</p>
                    <p>müller apparently does limited edition flavours such as raspberry doughnut and Jaffa cake, although this flavour is one of their permanent ones.
                         I wonder if someone in the UK has reviews of all the historical limited editions. That'd be cool.</p>

            <h3>June 8 2025. Chocolate flavoured... coconut water?</h3>
            <img src="cocobella_chocolate_coconut.jpg">
            <p>I'm not really sure if this can be considered a chocolate milk, since, well, it's not milk.</p>
            <p>I bought it anyway.</p>
            <p>Did I like it? Not particularly. I don't like coconut water when it's coconut water flavoured, and in my opinion the
                 words "chocolate" and "water" should never be put in the same sentence under any circumstances. It was, however, better than expected.</p>
            <p>I would still probably put it as a mid tier entry, but who knows - maybe someone that likes coconut water
                will think this is amazing. This is not really my area of expertise.</p>
            <p>So with that being said, you will not be finding chocolate coconut water in the ranking website. 
                And you will not be finding this stuff in my fridge. I will be sticking to drinks made with milk.

            <p>Okay so this is from the future, I thought I'd put this first to explain the purpose of this page.</p>
            <p>Mainly this will act as a changelog, for any new additions to the rankings.</p>
            <p>Also, occasionally I might have something that I think is worth saying. Something I think is interesting. That will go here too.</p>
            <p>This project was started in March of 2025, so the first 3 or so months are unlogged and unblogged. Nothing interesting happened for the first 3 months anyway.</p>
